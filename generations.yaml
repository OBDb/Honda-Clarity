generations:
  - name: "First Generation (FCX Clarity)"
    start_year: 2008
    end_year: 2014
    description: "The original Honda FCX Clarity was a limited-production hydrogen fuel cell vehicle that represented Honda's early commitment to fuel cell technology. Available only through a lease program in select markets with hydrogen infrastructure (primarily Southern California, Japan, and parts of Europe), it featured distinctive styling with a sloping roofline and unique proportions enabled by its purpose-built platform. Powered by Honda's V Flow fuel cell stack producing electricity to drive an electric motor with approximately 134 HP, it offered a range of about 240 miles on a full hydrogen tank. The interior featured seating for four with sustainable materials and a futuristic design befitting its advanced powertrain. As one of the first hydrogen fuel cell vehicles available to consumers (albeit in very limited numbers), the FCX Clarity served more as a technology demonstrator and real-world test platform than a mass-market vehicle. This generation established Honda's expertise in fuel cell technology while providing valuable data from real-world usage."

  - name: "Second Generation (Clarity Series)"
    start_year: 2016
    end_year: 2021
    description: "The second-generation Clarity expanded from a single fuel cell vehicle to a series of alternative powertrain models sharing a common body style. Available in three distinct variants: Fuel Cell (hydrogen), Electric (BEV), and Plug-in Hybrid, it represented Honda's multi-pathway approach to reducing emissions. The Fuel Cell version featured Honda's more compact, powerful fuel cell stack with approximately 174 HP and an improved range of 366 miles. The Electric version offered about 89 miles of range from its 25.5 kWh batteryâ€”limited compared to competitors but targeting specific urban markets. The Plug-in Hybrid combined a 1.5L Atkinson-cycle engine with an electric motor and 17 kWh battery for 47 miles of electric range plus gasoline backup. All variants featured distinctive styling with partially covered rear wheels for aerodynamic efficiency, though slightly more conventional than the original FCX Clarity. The interior offered premium appointments with sustainable materials, advanced technology, and seating for five. While the Fuel Cell version remained limited to areas with hydrogen infrastructure, the Plug-in Hybrid was available nationwide and became the volume seller of the lineup. Production ended in 2021 as Honda refocused its electrification strategy toward a new dedicated EV platform. This generation represented Honda's most significant effort to offer multiple zero or low-emission technologies in a single model line, providing valuable experience that would inform the company's future electrification efforts."
